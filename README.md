# Note Taker challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a note taker website. This consists of using js and express to make calls to the frontend provided for me. I created endpoints to handle get and post requests for handling user input on the site in server.js. I accomplished this with my skills in js and my knew knowledge of express.
